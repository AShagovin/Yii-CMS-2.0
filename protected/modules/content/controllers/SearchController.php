Former UFC middleweight Drew McFedries was stabbed Saturday night while working security at a nightclub in Davenport, Iowa.

Sherdog.com confirmed McFedries’ injury Tuesday with the fighter’s manager, Monte Cox, who relayed that McFedries was stabbed on the left side of his back, with the blade hitting his scapula. McFedries, who has worked at the club for about six months, managed to control the man until police arrived, according Cox, who revealed that the fighter was released after a few hours in the hospital.

According to a recent report from the Quad-City Times, 42-year-old Calvin Hammock allegedly stabbed McFedries on Saturday night at The Chorus Line. Police reportedly arrived on the scene at 11:44 p.m. and took Hammock to the Scott County Jail in Davenport.

According to the jail’s inmate records, Hammock has been charged with willful injury and going armed with intent, both felony charges. Those records also show that Hammock was admitted to the jail at 12:57 a.m. Sunday morning and was released 47 minutes later after posting a $10,000 bond.

McFedries, 34, most recently competed in August 2011, when he earned a technical knockout over Garrett Olson under the ProElite banner. The Iowa native competed for the UFC from November 2006 to September 2009, posting a 4-5 record during his nine-fight stint with the Las Vegas-based promotion. Known as “The Massacre,” McFedries owns eight of his 10 career victories by form of knockout and has gone the distance just once in his 11 years as a pro.
